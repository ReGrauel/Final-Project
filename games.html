Notes to myself:

I want to add the drop-down menu horizontally below the title and header, but I need to figure out how to get rid of the column/column lines that show up when it gets taken out

Also fit the header picture to whatever the shape is

Changing the text color in the body for CSS only affected gallery hours and also changed the color of the border over all three columns and specifically gallery hours

<h3>Insomnium</h3>
	<p>When you take a trip to your home town to visit a childhood friend, you slowly realize that something is wrong with the small town: friendly neighbors change at night, their personalities becoming dark and disturbing, but they have no recollection of what transpired the next morning. Something seems to be affecting this small town, and it is up to you to figure out what's going on. Unlock your forgotten childhood memories to figure out the mystery of this town, and who - or what - is pulling the strings.</p>
<h3>Code 410</h3>
	<p>After a scientific innovation that was meant to change the medical world for the better goes wrong, you find yourself locked in a hospital with sentient robots turned murderous, lead by a malfunctioning sentient server that controls the entire hospital. Can you survive organ-collecting robots long enough to escape a landscape that is constantly changing based on the whims of a machine? Or will you become one of the countless victims from this event, staff and patient alike?</p>
<h3>Fateless</h3>
	<p>Take fate into your own hands in this action packed adventure, where you play as the reincarnation of a knight of legend. Tensions are brewing in a landscape stopped by time, with the fate of this land resting on your shoulders. Will you follow in your old life's footsteps, filling in the void their absence left, or will you forge a new path, and become a legend of your own? The choice is up to you to decide, for you are fateless.</p>
